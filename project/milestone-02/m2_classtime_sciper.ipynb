        "## Brief overview of Classtime\n",
        "[Classtime](https://www.classtime.com/en/) is a Swiss EdTech startup that complements in-class teaching with immediate feedback on studentsâ€™ level of understanding. Teachers create ClassTime sessions for their class, where each session consists of *n* questions and a reflection in the end. Each student is tracked by a **participant_id**, which is unique within a session and in some cases can be tracked over sessions using the **social_user_id**. We have 5 data tables from this startup:\n",
        "- *sessions* (meta information about session format, teacher)\n",
        "- *questions* (all questions asked across sessions)\n",
        "- *answers* (each row represents a student answer to a question)\n",
        "- *reflection_questions* (4 reflection questions available to ask students)\n",
        "- *reflection_answers* (each row represents a student answer to a reflection questions)\n",
        "\n",
        "The *answers* table has been filtered to ~20% of the original dataset, only keeping participants who have also answered reflection questions. Similarly, the *questions* table has been filtered to only include questions where our subset of participants have answered. If you choose this dataset for the project, we will give you access to the full data later on.\n",
        "\n",
        "### sessions:\n",
        "- **id**: The unique identifier of a ClassTime session, also referred to in other tables as **session_id**.\n",
        "- **teacher_id**: The unique identifier of a teacher, who creates a Classtime session.\n",
        "- **title**: The title of the session. The default title is extracted from the Question Set title but the teacher can change it manually.\n",
        "- **participant_count**: N/A\n",
        "- **group**: N/A\n",
        "- **mode**: round-based = whole class goes through the session together, one question at the time, teacher gives the pace. flexible = teacher can still active/deactive questions but generally students can answer at their own pace.\n",
        "- **question_set_id**: Identifier of the question set that was used to create the session (not always populated). If this is the same for two sessions, it means the same questions were used for both.\n",
        "- **is_onboarding**: This session was automatically created by classtime when the teacher signed up to show him/her how classtime works and are not real sessions.\n",
        "- **feedback_mode**: per-question = solution is shown immediately after answering question, for each question. manual = solutions only shown when teacher triggers it\n",
        "- **is_one_attempt**: If  true, students cannot change their answers after submission (note that if students answer multiple times for the same question this will also show up in the answer dump as multiple rows).\n",
        "- **is_shuffle_choices**: For appropriate question types (i.e. multi-choice) randomly shuffle the options for each student. If False, show in order as it is defined in the question.\n",
        "- **is_shuffle_questions**: If true, randomly shuffle order of questions for each student, otherwise the same order is used for all students.\n",
        "- **is_partial_grading**: If true, ratings other than {0, question weight} are possible.\n",
        "- **platform_only**: If not empty (NaN), students need to identify themself (e.g. with their google account) to join the session. If NaN students can join with a nickname for the session and are not required to sign in.\n",
        "- **has_reflection**: If true, students can answer session reflection questions.\n",
        "- **force_reflection**: If true, teachers actively required students to answer session reflections.\n",
